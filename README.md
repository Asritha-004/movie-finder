# Movie Search Website

This project is a web application that allows users to search for movies using the OMDB API. It features a responsive design and provides a dynamic display of movie results.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Ensures compatibility across various devices.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for movies by title.
- **Random Movie Display**: Displays a random selection of movies from different genres.
- **Detailed Information**: Provides detailed information about each movie, including title, year, director, genre, IMDb rating, and plot.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For fetching and displaying movie data from the OMDB API.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Asritha-004/movie-search-app.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd movie-search-app
    ```
3. Replace `'your_api_key'` in the JavaScript file (`movie-finder2.js`) with your OMDB API key. You can obtain an API key from [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx).

- `movie_finder2.css`: The CSS file for styling the web page.
- `movie-finder2.js`: The JavaScript file for handling the movie search and API interactions.

## Notes

- Make sure to replace `'your_api_key'` in `movie-finder2.js` with your actual OMDB API key before running the app.
- Ensure you have an active internet connection to fetch movie data from the OMDB API.
